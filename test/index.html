                <div class="improved-answer">
                    <p><strong>I disagree that having your own room is unnecessary.</strong> I believe personal space is crucial for several reasons.</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>Firstly,</strong> privacy allows for better concentration when studying. For example, when I need to prepare for exams, having my own room means I can focus without interruptions from family conversations or television noise. My younger brother often plays video games loudly, which would make studying in a shared space nearly impossible.</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>Secondly,</strong> personal space supports mental health and independence. Teenagers especially need a place where they can express themselves freely, whether through decorating, listening to music, or simply having time alone to process their thoughts and emotions.</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>However,</strong> I understand the opposing view. Some people believe shared spaces strengthen family bonds and teach compromise. My friend Sarah argues that sharing rooms with siblings builds communication skills and prevents isolation. She shared a room with her sister for years and claims it made them closer.</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>On balance,</strong> while family unity is important, I think privacy and personal development outweigh these concerns, especially as children mature into adolescence and need space to develop their individual identities.</p>

                    <strong>Agree:</strong> According to the research, the percentage of urban residents suffering from depression is 30% higher than that of rural residents. Which means that there's a higher chanse you will get depression in the city than in the countryside.<br>
                    <strong>Disagree:</strong> In the countryside you have a less chanse to have a stable job, due to the fact that in the countryside people make money through farming, and farming heavily depends on weather.

                    <p><strong>This is a complex issue with valid arguments on both sides, though I lean toward preferring town life.</strong></p>
                    
                    <p><strong>Countryside advantages are significant.</strong> Studies suggest rural residents experience lower rates of anxiety and depression, likely due to reduced noise pollution, cleaner air, and stronger community connections. For example, my grandmother lives in a small village where neighbors genuinely know and support each other, creating a sense of belonging that's harder to find in cities.</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>However, urban areas offer crucial advantages.</strong> Towns provide better access to healthcare, education, and diverse career opportunities. When my cousin needed specialized medical treatment, living near the city meant receiving care within hours rather than traveling hundreds of kilometers. Additionally, cultural amenities like museums, theaters, and restaurants enrich daily life.</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>The employment argument is particularly important.</strong> While rural areas face economic challenges, modern technology enables remote work and online businesses, reducing this disadvantage. Nevertheless, certain professions‚Äîmedicine, law, engineering‚Äîstill require urban infrastructure.</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>My friend Marcus,</strong> who grew up on a farm, argues that countryside living teaches self-reliance and environmental awareness that city dwellers lack. However, I believe the educational and professional opportunities in towns ultimately provide better long-term prospects, especially for young people.</p>

                    <p><strong>I strongly agree that smoking should not be allowed in public spaces, though complete prohibition raises complex issues.</strong></p>
                    
                    <p><strong>The health evidence is overwhelming.</strong> According to the World Health Organization, tobacco kills over 8 million people annually, including 1.2 million non-smokers exposed to secondhand smoke. I've witnessed this personally‚Äîmy uncle, a lifelong non-smoker, developed lung cancer after decades of exposure to cigarette smoke in his workplace.</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>Secondhand smoke particularly concerns me</strong> because it violates others' right to clean air. Children in smoking households face higher risks of asthma, respiratory infections, and developmental problems. Public smoking bans have already proven effective‚Äîrestaurants and offices became healthier environments when smoking was prohibited.</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>However, complete prohibition raises questions about personal freedom.</strong> Some argue that adults should have the right to make their own health choices, even poor ones. The challenge lies in balancing individual liberty with public health protection.</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>My friend David,</strong> whose father is a heavy smoker, believes personal responsibility matters more than laws. He argues that education and support for quitting are more effective than prohibition. While I appreciate this perspective, I think the addictive nature of nicotine makes purely voluntary approaches insufficient for protecting public health.</p>

                    <p><strong>Environmental protection requires both individual responsibility and systemic change, and I believe we need action at every level.</strong></p>
                    
                    <p><strong>On a personal level,</strong> I can reduce my carbon footprint through daily choices. I've started using public transportation instead of asking for car rides, which reduces emissions and saves money. At home, I practice the "3 Rs"‚Äîreduce, reuse, recycle‚Äîby avoiding single-use plastics, repurposing containers, and properly sorting waste. Additionally, I'm gradually shifting toward a more plant-based diet, as livestock farming contributes significantly to greenhouse gas emissions.</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>However,</strong> individual efforts alone aren't sufficient. Some argue that corporations and governments bear greater responsibility since they control large-scale pollution sources. For instance, just 100 companies produce 71% of global emissions, suggesting that systemic change is more crucial than personal actions.</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>Others believe</strong> that consumer choices drive corporate behavior, making personal responsibility vital. When millions choose eco-friendly products, companies adapt their practices accordingly. This "vote with your wallet" approach has already pushed many businesses toward sustainable practices.</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>My perspective combines both approaches.</strong> While maintaining personal environmental practices, I also support political candidates who prioritize climate action and companies with demonstrated sustainable practices. Effective environmental protection requires change at individual, corporate, and governmental levels‚Äîno single approach is sufficient alone.</p>

                    <p><strong>History serves as humanity's collective memory, offering invaluable lessons for navigating contemporary challenges.</strong></p>
                    
                    <p><strong>Primarily,</strong> history teaches us about the consequences of actions and decisions across time. The rise and fall of civilizations reveal how factors like environmental degradation, economic inequality, and political corruption can destabilize entire societies. For example, the collapse of Easter Island civilization demonstrates how unsustainable resource exploitation can lead to societal breakdown‚Äîa lesson highly relevant to modern climate change discussions.</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>Additionally,</strong> history provides frameworks for understanding current events. The patterns of how past societies addressed pandemics, economic crises, or social movements offer valuable insights. During COVID-19, many public health responses drew from lessons learned during the 1918 flu pandemic, including the importance of early intervention and clear communication.</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>However, some argue</strong> that historical circumstances were so fundamentally different that past lessons don't apply to modern situations. They contend that technology, globalization, and social evolution have created entirely new contexts that make historical comparisons irrelevant or misleading.</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>While contexts certainly change,</strong> I believe fundamental human nature and social dynamics remain remarkably consistent. The same emotions, motivations, and power structures that drove historical events continue to influence modern society, making historical knowledge highly relevant for understanding and shaping our future.</p>

                    <strong>Agree:</strong> For those who are applying for jobs in the company, they will spend a lot of time working outdoors, most of the personnel still go to work at the company, even if someone is still working at home, but this ratio has obviously increased ever since.<br>
                    <strong>Disagree:</strong> With the generation's update, we didn't depend on those hard work outdoors, rather we chose to work at home as we can, therefore, in the foreseeable future, the number of people who prefer to work at home will far exceed the number of people who work outdoors. This is due to the changing times. Our work is different from that which requires us to go out and arrive at a designated location. Instead, we get in touch with the outside world at home.

                    <p><strong>I agree that people generally spend too little quality time at home, despite recent changes in work patterns.</strong></p>
                    
                    <p><strong>Before the pandemic,</strong> many people's lives revolved around external activities‚Äîlong commutes, extended work hours, social obligations, and entertainment outside the home. For example, my parents often left home at 7 AM and returned after 8 PM, leaving little time for family interaction, home-cooked meals, or personal relaxation. Weekends were frequently consumed by errands, social events, or children's activities.</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>While remote work has increased home presence,</strong> this doesn't necessarily mean quality time at home. Many people now struggle with work-life boundaries, turning their homes into 24/7 offices. My neighbor complains that she's physically home more but mentally less present with her family due to constant video calls and emails.</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>Furthermore,</strong> modern technology often distracts us even when we're physically home. Family members may sit in the same room while absorbed in separate digital worlds‚Äîphones, tablets, streaming services‚Äîreducing meaningful interaction.</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>My friend Jennifer disagrees,</strong> arguing that people now have more flexibility to balance home and work life. She works remotely three days per week and feels more connected to her home environment. However, I think she's fortunate to have a job that truly supports work-life balance, which isn't available to everyone.</p>

                    The standard to define a good school must stand on various sides and perspectives, for example, I think the most important to be a good school depends on their school meal. If these foods are terrible, the school will not be a good school then, but some people said to me, the criteria for the quality of school is education. Others might consider the standard of the school's education to be "That depends on whether you have a nice teacher.", But I have a contrary opinion, the teacher's study is not the only factor that affects your study, rather the qualities of education may be the most significant one.

                    <p><strong>A good education should develop both intellectual abilities and personal character, though people prioritize different aspects.</strong></p>
                    
                    <p><strong>In my view,</strong> excellent education has three core elements. First, it should foster critical thinking rather than mere memorization. The best classes I've experienced encouraged questioning, debate, and independent analysis. Second, good education must be personalized‚Äîrecognizing that students have different learning styles, interests, and paces. Finally, it should prepare students for real-world challenges through practical skills like problem-solving, communication, and collaboration.</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>However, priorities vary significantly.</strong> Some parents emphasize academic achievement and standardized test scores, believing these determine future success. They prefer schools with rigorous curricula and high university acceptance rates. Others prioritize social-emotional development, seeking environments that build confidence, empathy, and leadership skills.</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>Cultural differences also matter.</strong> In some societies, good education means respect for authority and traditional knowledge. In others, creativity and innovation are valued more highly. Finnish education systems, for example, emphasize play-based learning and minimal testing, while East Asian systems often focus on discipline and academic excellence.</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>Ultimately,</strong> I believe the best education balances academic rigor with personal development, adapting to individual student needs while preparing them to contribute meaningfully to society. The goal shouldn't just be high grades, but developing thoughtful, capable, and ethical human beings.</p>

                    <p><strong>While car-free living offers significant environmental benefits, I believe it's not practical for everyone in current circumstances.</strong></p>
                    
                    <p><strong>The environmental argument is compelling.</strong> Transportation accounts for about 24% of global CO2 emissions, with private cars contributing substantially. Cities like Copenhagen show that extensive cycling infrastructure and public transit can dramatically reduce car dependency while improving air quality and public health.</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>However, geographic and social realities complicate this ideal.</strong> Rural residents often lack public transportation alternatives, making cars essential for work, healthcare, and daily needs. Additionally, people with disabilities, elderly individuals, or those with young children may find cars indispensable for mobility and independence.</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>My friend Maria, who lives car-free in Amsterdam,</strong> argues that most people overestimate their car needs. She manages perfectly with cycling and trains, even for weekend trips. However, I think her situation‚Äîliving in a bike-friendly city with excellent public transit‚Äîisn't available to everyone.</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>The solution likely involves</strong> reducing car dependency through better urban planning and public transportation, rather than complete elimination. Electric vehicles and car-sharing programs can bridge the gap while we develop more sustainable transportation systems.</p>

                    Someone thinks that freedom does mean you are not limited, you can do whatever you want to do. But I think that freedom does not just mean in the case of material things, rather in every aspect, including mental-freedom, physiology-freedom, and the last one- single freedom. Individual freedom does not mean loneliness, rather to find things you really, actually want to find. For example: Many people consider money as the most important thing in their life, because money is able to solve almost everything, but when you pay more attention to your hobbies, you will find that the joy of life is not limited to material freedom, but a deeper, and more esoteric freedom. Exactly like these really you wished, and didn't be limited in the small ideal-space, that's the true meaning of freedom.

                    <p><strong>Freedom operates on multiple levels‚Äîpersonal, social, and political‚Äîeach with distinct meanings and limitations.</strong></p>
                    
                    <p><strong>On an individual level,</strong> freedom means the ability to make authentic choices about my life's direction. This includes freedom from external pressures to conform, freedom to express my thoughts and beliefs, and freedom to pursue personal growth. However, true personal freedom requires self-discipline and responsibility‚ÄîI'm only free when I can choose based on my values rather than impulses or social expectations.</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>Politically, freedom involves</strong> democratic participation, rule of law, and protection of civil liberties. Citizens need freedom of speech, assembly, and press to hold governments accountable. Economic freedom‚Äîthe ability to participate in markets and own property‚Äîalso matters, though this must be balanced with social welfare to ensure everyone has meaningful opportunities.</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>However, absolute freedom is impossible and undesirable.</strong> My freedom to play loud music ends where my neighbor's freedom to sleep begins. Societies must balance individual liberty with collective well-being, leading to ongoing debates about issues like public health measures, taxation, and regulation.</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>Some philosophers argue</strong> that freedom is primarily about removing external constraints, while others emphasize positive freedom‚Äîhaving the actual power and resources to achieve one's goals. I believe both dimensions matter: legal rights mean little without economic opportunities to exercise them meaningfully.</p>
